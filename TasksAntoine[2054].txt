Antoine:
(N first nodes)

Kendall Tau (Total)
plot x:log(N), y:%match from two lists
plot x:influence, y:%match from two lists
plot x:N, y: Kendall Tau between the N first Emul Vs order of same nodes in complete Model list
Analyse the graph statistics (diameter, connected components, triangles, etc.)
Calculate for all users: Influence, Tweet Rate, Re-tweet Rate, Num. Followers, Num. Leader,  +2 centrality metrics (How to present in the paper?)
Validation on different granularities. 
Validation with other traces. (Find!)
Train a machine learning model with various features (activity,centrality) and compare VS model prediction.
Sensitivity, Conditioning, which user can perturb most the solution by change of activity.
Which user can influence most if she stops re-tweeting and stops tweeting. 
Find %of weak activity users and double their tweet/re-tweet activity. What happens?
Relations with PageRank and application of MapReduce.
Communities in Adjacency Graph and Graph with Activity Weight.
Generate artificial input traces to compare Emulator VS model programs.
Can we find bots and estimate their influence/features.
